# CS50 Projects Repository

Welcome to my CS50 Projects Repository! This collection showcases the projects I completed as part of [CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/). Each project represents a key concept taught in the course, ranging from foundational programming to advanced algorithms.

## üåü **Overview**

CS50 is an intensive introduction to computer science, covering programming languages like C, Python, and JavaScript, as well as essential concepts such as data structures, algorithms, web development, and more. Through hands-on projects, I applied theoretical knowledge to build practical and creative solutions.

This repository contains:
- **Problem Sets:** Solutions to CS50's weekly assignments.
- **Final Project:** My own unique application showcasing skills learned in the course.
