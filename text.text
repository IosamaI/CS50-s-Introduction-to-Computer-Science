In ASCII (the character encoding standard), each character has a unique numeric code. For example:
'A' has an ASCII value of 65.
'B' has an ASCII value of 66.
'C' has an ASCII value of 67, and so on.
'H' has an ASCII value of 72.
By subtracting 'A' from 'H' (i.e., 72 - 65), we get 7, which is the position of 'H' in the alphabet if we start counting from 0. This allows us to map each letter to a unique index between 0 and 25 for the 26 letters of the English alphabet.


Why Subtract 'A'?
When we write word[i] - 'A', we are effectively shifting the ASCII value of the letter to get a zero-based index:

'A' - 'A' gives 0.
'B' - 'A' gives 1.
'C' - 'A' gives 2, and so on.
This index allows us to access the POINTS array where each element corresponds to a letter's score (from A to Z). This way, the POINTS array can be accessed directly using the letter's alphabetical position, simplifying score calculations for each character in the word.
