1- To characterize this listener’s audio aura, I would look at the average values for energy, valence, and danceability
 of their top songs. These attributes give insights into the vibe and emotional tone of the music they prefer.
 Higher values might indicate upbeat and happy music, while lower values could indicate mellower or more introspective music.




 2-Simply averaging values may not accurately represent the listener’s tastes. For example,
  a listener might enjoy a mix of high-energy and low-energy songs. Instead of a straightforward average, 
  it could be more meaningful to weigh these values based on
  listening frequency or cluster songs into distinct mood categories, 
  capturing a fuller spectrum of the listener’s preferences.
